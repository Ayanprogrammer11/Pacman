# Pacman

A classic arcade game of Pacman, made with vanilla Javascript.

## Description

This project is a web-based version of the popular Pacman game, where the player controls a yellow character that eats dots and avoids ghosts in a maze. The game features four different levels, each with increasing difficulty and different layouts. The game ends when the player loses all their lives or clears all the dots on the screen.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have a web browser that supports Javascript. You can either download the source code from this repository or clone it using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/AyanProgrammer11/pacman.git`

Then, open the `index.html` file in your browser and enjoy the game!

## Usage

You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move Pacman around the maze. You can also pause the game by pressing the spacebar. The game will keep track of your score and lives on the top of the screen. You can also see the current level and the number of remaining dots on the bottom of the screen.

## Credits

This project was inspired by the original Pacman game, created by Namco in 1980. The code was written by me, using vanilla Javascript and HTML5 canvas.
